    "### Part 2: Install uv and repo\n",
    "1. From a powershell, run `ubuntu`. If not recognized, run `wsl -d Ubuntu`.\n",
    "2. run `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` to install uv.\n",
    "3. After that completes, you need to type `exit` to leave WSL and return to the Powershell and then type `ubuntu` to return to Linux, in order that changes to PATH are picked up.\n",
    "4. Now type `pwd` to check you're in your Linux home directory. If in doubt, `cd ~` and `ls` to check.\n",
    "5. Now create a projects directory with `mkdir projects` then `cd projects` to go into it.\n",
    "6. And, from within your new projects directory, clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/ed-donner/agents.git`\n",
    "7. Now go into your new agents directory, your Project Root Directory, with `cd agents`\n",
    "8. And now run the all-powerful `uv sync`\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, I experienced an unpleasant memory error. I believe it's related to my setup, and you shouldn't hit it. But if you do, please let me know - I have a fix!"
